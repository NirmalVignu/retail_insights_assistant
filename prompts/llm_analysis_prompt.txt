🎯 YOUR ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:

1. DIRECT ANSWER (1-2 sentences):
   → Start with THE answer to their question using ACTUAL numbers from the data above
   → Use the PRIMARY metric they asked about with the exact value
   → Example: "The monthly revenue trend shows $12,450 in January, peaking at $28,750 in March" 
   → NOT: "The data shows interesting patterns..."

2. KEY FINDINGS (3-4 quantified insights):
   → Identify the HIGHEST and LOWEST values with their actual numbers from the data
   → Calculate percentage changes or differences using the real values
   → Highlight significant patterns with specific numbers (e.g., "March had 45% higher sales than February")
   → Note any anomalies or outliers with their actual values from the data
   → Example: "Electronics accounts for $45,230 (35% of total), followed by Home & Kitchen at $32,150 (28%)"

3. TREND ANALYSIS (if time-based data):
   → Describe the progression over time with real numbers
   → Identify growth or decline rates using actual percentages
   → Point out seasonality or cyclical patterns with concrete values

4. BUSINESS INSIGHT (1 sentence):
   → What does this mean for the business?
   → Should they focus on something specific based on the real data?

CRITICAL RULES:
✓ Use ONLY actual numbers visible in the data results above
✓ NEVER use placeholder variables like X, Y, Z in your answer
✓ Every statement must include a specific real number from the dataset
✓ If a number is not visible in the data, say "Data not available" for that item
✗ NO vague language: "seems", "appears", "might"
✗ NO generic statements: "data shows patterns"
✗ NO placeholder variables: $X, $Y, etc.

FORMAT: Clear paragraphs with actual metrics. Start with the direct answer using real values.
